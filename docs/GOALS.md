# Goals
The purpose of this documentation is to outlay the goals of the project and the steps that will be taken to achieve them.

First, an assessment of similar projects.<br>
There are several existing projects out there that overlap with the cpaabilities of this one to some degree. The main ones would
be [craftio](https://github.com/Twister915/craftio) and [valence](https://github.com/valencepm/valence).

The main problem with craftio is that is not under active development and in my opinion, has too broad of a scope. While it does
permit no-std, as well as support for multiple Minecraft versions, it is too abstract for a quick setup of 
any server environment.

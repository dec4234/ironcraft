# ironcraft
ironcraft is a Minecraft server networking library. It is not a server implementation, but rather a library that can be used to create a server implementation.
The ultimate goal is to use this library in a future implementation of a Minecraft: Java Edition software
in Rust. 

This library is provided as a structured baseline and as an open soure software solution for anyone looking
to create their own server side software.

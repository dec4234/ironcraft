# ironcraft
ironcraft is a **Minecraft: Java Edition** networking library. It is not a server implementation, but rather a library that can be used to create your own servers and clients.
The ultimate goal is to use this library in a future implementation of a Minecraft: Java Edition software
in Rust. 

This library is provided as a structured baseline and as an open source software solution for anyone looking
to create specialized **Minecraft: Java Edition** servers or clients.
